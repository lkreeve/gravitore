## Details

The html version of this doesn't play in Safari. I'm still working on getting other versions available to play. When you play it in the browser it is laggy and the music and sound effects are very low quailty. If you want to play it with higher quality install [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) and download the code and asset file from [gravitore](https://github.com/lkreeve/gravitore).
